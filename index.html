With it, he took what Isaac Newton had discovered about gravity, but for the first time in history, the world knew what made gravity exist.</figcaption>

			<ul>
				<li>Birth March 14, 1879 Ulm (Germany)</li>
				<li>He was a German physicist of Jewish origin, later nationalized Swiss, Austrian and American.</li>
				<li>In 1905, as an unknown young physicist employed at the Berne Patent Office, he published his theory of special relativity. In it he incorporated, in a simple theoretical framework based on simple physical postulates, concepts and phenomena previously studied by Henri Poincaré and Hendrik Lorentz. As a logical consequence of this theory, he deduced the most popular physics equation: the mass-energy equivalence, E = mc². That year, he published other works that would lay some of the foundations of statistical physics and quantum mechanics.</li>
				<li>In 1915, he presented the theory of general relativity, in which he completely reformulated the concept of gravity.</li>
				<li>For his explanations of the photoelectric effect and his numerous contributions to theoretical physics, in 1921 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics but not for the Theory of Relativity.</li>
				<li>Before the rise of Nazism, Einstein left Germany in December 1932 for the United States, where he dedicated himself to teaching at the Institute for Advanced Study.</li>
				<li>He became a US citizen in 1940.</li>
				<li>During his last years he worked to integrate the gravitational force and the electromagnetic force into a single theory.</li>
				<li>Died April 18, 1955 (age 76) Princeton (New Jersey) (United States)</li>
